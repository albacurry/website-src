			I am currently working on four projects, each encompassing several papers:

			<p><a href="#apologia">
			I - An Apologia for Anger
		</a>
			</p>
			<p><a href="#philemon">
			II - Philosophy of Emotions and Moral Psychology Informed by Feminist Critiques and Chinese Philosophy
			</a></p>
			<p>
			III - Comedy as an Amnesty Space
			</p>
			<p>
			IV - Ethics of Emotion AI 
		   </p>

		   
			<h4><a id="apologia">
				I - An Apologia for Anger
			</a>
			</h4>
			<p>
			The first project argues for the moral and political value of anger. 
		</p><p>
			My main argument is the subject of my dissertation 
		</p><p>
			I am preparing an article exploring the impact that psychoanalytic theories, such as the concept of sublimation, have in normative theories of emotion by focusing on the relationship between anger and fear. Although aggression plays a role in both emotions, current scholarship tends to exclusively associate aggression with anger rather than fear. Anger then ends up as more morally blameworthy than fear, even though from both epistemic and physiological points of view, no sufficient distinction is made for such a normative condemnation. 
		</p><p>
			Another article underway, this time with a more historical angle, undertakes a comparative analysis of Nietzsche’s ressentiment, Aristotle’s notion of anger as necessary for virtue, and early Chinese debates about yuan 怨 (translated variously as “anger” and “resentment”). I articulate the differences between anger and resentment, so often used as synonyms in the English language (think Joseph Butler’s “Upon Resentment and and Forgiveness of Injuries”). Aristotle’s anger is seen as necessary (in the right situation and to the right degree) for virtuous behaviour as well as politics. Nietzche famously criticizes ressentiment. Interestingly, as much as anger is problematized by Chinese philosophers, yuan, which is not generally associated with aggression since it is described as more of a passive attitude, is much more maligned.

<h4><a id="philemon">
	II - Philosophy of Emotions and Moral Psychology Informed by Feminist Critiques and Chinese Philosophy</a>
</h4>
<p>
The second project is my long-term project is to build a renewal of an Aristotelian account of emotion that is informed by feminist critiques and by Pre-Qin Chinese philosophy. It is Aristotelian in the sense that part of what it means to be virtuous is to feel the right emotion, to the right degree, with the accompanying assumption that one can develop or habituate one’s emotions. By feminist critiques, I mean work focused on examining the gender-specific experiencing emotion as opposed to the purportedly genderless epistemic subject of traditional philosophy. Chinese philosophy, in different ways, is more sensitive to ethical issues that arise out of one’s perceived hierarchical status than Aristotle was. Both feminist and Chinese philosophers are interested in the problem of uptake, having one’s emotions properly judged and received by others, by those in positions of power. Feminist critiques complicate and criticize the narratives of genderless anger told by those in power, and Chinese philosophers fully acknowledge the importance of role-based societes and the implications of such roles in the emotional make-up of subjects.
</p><p>
An article underway compares early China’s and ancient Greece’s philosophical attitudes towards female anger. I argue that the reason there are no positive examples of female anger in ancient Greece is because it is conceptually incompatible with female virtues as conceived in ancient Greece. On the other hand, there are many examples of positive anger in early China, because female virtues were other-regarding and so was anger in many cases.
